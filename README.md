# SelectionSort
The selection sort does not swap each time  it finds elements out of position. Selection sort  makes a complete pass while searching for the  next item to swap. At the end of a pass once  the item is located, one swap is made.

Time Complexity 

Best Case = O(N^2)
Avg. Case =  O(N^2)
Worst Case =  O(N^2)
